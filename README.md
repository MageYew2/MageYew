### About Me

How did I get here? 
Wow. It's been a journey.
As a teen, I made websites for fun. It was a great hobby where I mastered basic HTML, CSS and graphic design. 
Creativity has always been a passion of mine and I thrived on the challenge.

Well, now it has been 20 years and I'm relearning what I had since forgotten and more. While my previous experience was very focused on the front end, now I am working through the curriculums offered by Boot.dev and TheOdinProject in an attempt to become a full stack developer and create web applications.

Currently, I am working as part of two different startups. 
The first is a solo project that serves homesteaders and small scale farmers. I'm hoping to launch the beta version of the business by October 2025.
The second is a much larger project so will likely not launch until later in 2026. It will be a self-publishing platform for creators and artists to work together and share their stories in the form of visual novels. I'm super excited and I'm working with two others to make this a reality.
